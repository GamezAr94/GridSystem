# Grid System
This project I created a grid system where I can change a value in each grid cell just by clicking it and also get the info of the value stored in it.It is a base to create a heat map where the grid cells change color depends of how long the cursor stays in each cell or a path finding program.

# What I Learned
* Multi dimensional array.
* Use of text mesh.
* Use of Vector3.
